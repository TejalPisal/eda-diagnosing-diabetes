# EDA: Diagnosing Diabetes

This project is part of Codecademy's Data Science Path and focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to diabetes diagnoses. The goal is to analyze, clean, and validate the data to ensure its quality for future modeling or interpretation.

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains diagnostic measurements for female patients and is originally from the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases**. It was provided as part of the Codecademy learning platform.

### Columns:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration (2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test)
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin
- **BMI**: Body mass index
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age in years
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0: No diabetes, 1: Diabetes)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Project Tasks
- Initial data inspection
- Null value detection and handling
- Replacing invalid values (e.g., 0s in clinical columns)
- Outlier detection
- Data type validation and correction
- Pattern recognition in missing data
- Impute missing values with median/mean
- Use `.value_counts()` to explore categorical distribution
